# Practice-EDA

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data from a bank and building a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank. The analysis is performed using a dataset of 10,000 customers with various attributes such as demographics, account information, and activity levels.
**This is a practice exploratory data analysis project. I am learning how to perform data analysis, visualize data, and build predictive models.**

The main objectives of this project are:
1.To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors influencing customer churn.
2.To preprocess the data for modeling by handling categorical variables, missing values, and outliers.
3.To build a predictive model using a Random Forest classifier to predict the likelihood of customer churn.
4.To identify the top 20 customers most likely to churn based on the model's predictions.

**Steps in the Analysis:**
1.Load the Data: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
2.Data Cleaning: Drop unnecessary columns and handle missing values if any.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
4.Visualize the distribution of key variables.
5.Analyze categorical variables using bar plots.
6.Analyze continuous variables using box plots and histograms.
7.Feature Engineering: Convert categorical variables into dummy variables.
8.Model Building:
0.Split the data into training and testing sets.
10.Train a Random Forest classifier.
11.Predict churn probabilities on the test set.
12.Identify High-Risk Customers: Identify the top 20 customers most likely to churn.
